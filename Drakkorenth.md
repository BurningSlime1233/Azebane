An ancient dynasty of [[Dragonborn]] with a unique genetic quirk of all members of the bloodline being a random different kind of dragonborn. The bloodline goes back to before the Cleansing where they ruled all of [[Drakoderior]]. The kingdom is called [[Drakkorenth]] and it is not known whether the rulers named themselves after the land or named the land after themselves. The royal bloodline prides themselves over magic and any descendant of the bloodline who does not possess the ability to do magic is ostracized. Anyone who marries into the bloodline must undergo a ritual to be transformed into a dragonborn if they wish to take any position of political power. The current leader is [[Queen Yuras]] who is a Crystal [[Dragonborn]] Psion. The capital city is [[Drakken]].
