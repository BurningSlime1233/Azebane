Aziraphale is one of the 24 [[Solar|Solars]], a type of [[Celestial]] [[Angel]], that remain after the [[Dawn War]]. For the past 40,000 years he has been working for [[Kelemvor]]. Most recently, he has made it his mission to prevent the resurrection of Dead [[Gods]] after [[The Cleansing]]. He has been working on stopping the last remaining angel of [[Loki]] and the [[Ulitharid]] known as [[The Mentor]]. 

One day, Aziraphale was notified of someone trespassing in the [[Silvery Void]]. Aziraphale arrived before [[Anubis]] had to take action. He realized that the trespassing [[Astral Elf]] was not in control of his own mind. He decided to suppress the Elf's memories and made him his warlock. Soon, [[Istara Galaxtien]] would travel to the material plane.

He travelled to [[Laikedrari]] where he had a group of adventurers fight a [[Demidritch]] who wielded a sword called [[Laevateinn]], one of the remaining [[Artifact|Artifacts]] of [[Loki]]. After the [[Demidritch]] was slain, the sword was taken by Aziraphale to be destroyed. After this was handled, Aziraphale would return to his warlock, [[Istara Galaxtien]] in order to give him a task to oversee another such Demidritch, [[Vaey Victus]]. Due to Vaey's relationship with Istara, Aziraphale was able to convince the other other Gods of Death to not attempt to kill Vaey, believing Vaey could be redeemed. This led to [[Myrkul]] gaining interest in Victus.
