Astral elves are [[Elf|elves]] that left the [[Material Plane]] and fled to the [[Astral Plane]]. Those who originate from [[Azebane]] left before [[The Cleansing]] in order to flee the wrath of the gods. Their bodies have adapted and been modified by the Astral. They can have either purple, pink or pale white skin and either white, black or purple hair. They left the Astral in order to procreate and raise their children. They live on [[Wildjammers]] or large pieces of debris in the Astral and are some of the longest lived mortals.
