The Épée Sanguines were swords that date back to [[The First Dawn]] although their origin has long since been forgotten. The only Thirsting Épée Sanguine was created using the blood of [[Cadogan Argent, Exarch of Blood]] not long after his ascension to godhood. The other Épée Sanguines were made to replicate it but did not succeed. When Cadogan Argent fled, the Thirsting blade disappeared with him.
