This country is extremely hot at about 60ÂºC on average.

The capital is the largest volcano on Azebane called [[The Ashen Precipice]]. It is a large city of gray skinned [[dwarves|]] called basalt Dwarves, Salamanders and Azers. Vulphateor is ruled by a triumvirate of 3 kings, one of each race. The dwarven king is Thyrebrum Flamestoker, the salamander king is a millenia old Salamander Noble called Argoxacan and the leader of the Azers is named Amaimon. The Ashen Precipice is a massive city built around and inside an active volcano. There are 2 types of cities in Vulphateor, volcanic cities which are not very hospitable to those without fire resistance and a small number of strongholds with cold magic making it habitable for those without fire resistance and the place travelers most often visit to purchase metalwork. The country is most well known for its metalwork, gemstones and metals as dwarves, salamanders and azers are the best in all the realms.
