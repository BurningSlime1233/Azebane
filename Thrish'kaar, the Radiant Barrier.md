The Radiant Barrier is a large wall of golden light that protects the majority of [[Laikedrari]] from the dangers of [[Exar'mu'sharn, the Abyssal Rot|Exar’mu’sharn]] and deals a large amount of damage (18d10 + 36 radiant) to any fiend or undead crossing through unprotected. Powerful [[Fiend|fiends]] and [[Undead|undead]] are able to use magic to weaken or nullify the barrier at points to pass through. The barrier is powered by worship and spells. [[Endel'a'daneth|Endel]] occasionally sends small armies through the barrier in order to reduce worshippers and casters and weaken the barrier enough to allow the Abyssal Rot to expand.
