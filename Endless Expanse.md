The Endless Expanse is a Demiplane within the [[Astral Plane]] that is segmented off and partitioned, allowing storage and is accessed through objects like Bags of Holding, Portable Holes or Handy Haversacks. Most people, including almost all magic item craftsmen, do not know of this reality. The existence of this Demiplane is limited to planar scholars who do not tell others of this Demiplane partially because most people would refuse to believe it but also to allow the continued usage of these items. 

[[Tindalos, the Lord of the Endless Expanse]] is the name of the creator of this Plane and the first victim transformed by the nature of this Plane. Any kind of tampering with items that connect to the plane can draw the attention of the residents of this plane. People that are stored in bags of holding or portable holes often get taken and are never found again, atleast not in any recognizable state. They are left to wander the Endless Expanse, slowly driven to madness in the unending piles of abandoned garbage left behind until they are turned into [[Bagmen]].
