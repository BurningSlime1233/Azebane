The Shoproterron Empire is a country in North [[Obseofaris]] that contests [[Cirittapan]] over dominion of [[The Plaigus Sea]]. Unlike its rival, Cirittapan, The Shoproterron Empire also wishes to rule over the mainland but is bounded by [[Vulphateor]]. A large majority of their mainland is covered in a bamboo forest called [[Fukui Forest]]. Also unlike their rivals, they value honor and fairness in battle. In order to compete against the Cirittapan, they wield a small colony of [[krakens|Kraken]]. The [[samurai|Samurai]] originate from here and various [[Monastic Order|monastic orders]] have major locations here.
