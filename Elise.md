Elise is a [[The Corrupted|corrupted human]] born to a [[Yuan-Ti]] Pureblood mother, Eksolas, and [[Cursed Blood]] father, Jazaraud Ranakh. Her father was a wild blood, [[Blood Hunter]] and the mother a Wizard and both retired adventurers. The blood hunter transformation should have made her father infertile but due to his cursed nature, it did not work correctly, causing the resulting offspring to be born corrupted.

Her father was travelling and had died by the time the mother found out she was pregnant. Even before she was born, Elise was devouring magic and matter which caused her mother to lose weight rapidly and impeded her ability to cast spells as well. Once Elise was born, she needed to constantly be fed magic or get sick. This resulted in her mother leaving her job at a magical academy in order to better take care of Elise. She studied the creation of magical batteries in order to prevent Elise from losing her magic and began research into ways to cure Elise. She began bleeding the wealth she had accumulated and eventually went deep into debt. 

 Eksolas' constant failure caused her to gradually lose her sanity as she would watch her daughter get closer and closer to death and was helpless. She began to stay in her tower for longer and longer durations of time and after a point would only leave in order to get resources to help Elise. She became more and more paranoid of others discovering Elise and how poorly it could go for her. The wizards from her former place of work found out she was losing her sanity and reported her to greater authorities. These authorities would travel to her tower where they apprehended her and took her into the Astral Plane to be imprisoned until cured. Eksolas
