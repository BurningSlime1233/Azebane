The expansive and unruled plains of [[Laikedrari]] are called the Velds. The people of the Velds value their independence and are not ruled by any empire. There are 2 major cities in the velds but numerous smaller towns and villages.

The port city, [[Absolus]], is a major trading post as trades there are uncontrolled and unrestricted with minimum duty. It is the largest place for illicit and regulated goods and purchase of rare and taboo magical ingredients is its largest money maker. The city has no direct ruler but is ruled indirectly by a powerful Ak’chazar [[Rakshasa]] named [[Valantajar]]. He uses necromancy and has killed all major powers in the city and revived them under his control.

The other major city in the Velds is [[Baerth Citadel]]. It is a large fortified city led by a group of Paladins (Oath of the Watchers and Weaveknights called the Legion of Chains. Their goal is to protect Azebane from extraplanar threats and are currently working to stop the spread of the Abyssal Rot. They work alongside the Amarundans and Xiburgs in maintaining Thrish’kaar. They work in preventing incursions and often go on expeditions into the Rot to fight back. Baerth used to be a city under the empire but after the rot began, only the citadel was left standing. The Legion of Chains helped the 2 countries that remained standing and the city of Absolus in retaking a majority of the Velds and in the casting of the Radiant Barrier.
