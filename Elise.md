Elise is a [[The Corrupted|corrupted human]] born to a [[Yuan-Ti]] Pureblood mother, Eksolas, and [[Cursed Blood]] father, Jazaraud Ranakh. Her father was a wild blood, [[Blood Hunter]] and the mother a Wizard and both retired adventurers. The [[Hunter's Bane]] transformation should have made her father infertile but due to his cursed nature, it did not work correctly, causing the resulting offspring to be born corrupted.

Her father was travelling and had died by the time the mother found out she was pregnant. Even before she was born, Elise was devouring magic and matter which caused her mother to lose weight rapidly and impeded her ability to cast spells as well. Once Elise was born, she needed to constantly be fed magic or get sick. This resulted in her mother leaving her job at a magical academy in order to better take care of Elise. She studied the creation of magical batteries in order to prevent Elise from losing her magic and began research into ways to cure Elise. She began bleeding the wealth she had accumulated and eventually went deep into debt. 

 Eksolas' constant failure caused her to gradually lose her sanity as she would watch her daughter get closer and closer to death and was helpless. She began to stay in her tower for longer and longer durations of time and after a point would only leave in order to get resources to help Elise. She became more and more paranoid of others discovering Elise and how poorly it could go for her. The wizards from her former place of work found out she was losing her sanity and reported her to greater authorities. These authorities would travel to her tower where they apprehended her and took her into the Astral Plane to be imprisoned until cured. Eksolas, before her arrest, saw the authorities coming and hid Elise in the basement with all the accumulated arcane batteries.

Elise stayed there for what felt close 2 weeks, barely sustaining herself on the little food and water available to her. Once the arcane batteries began to run out, She started to feel unwell and began to attempt to leave but was unable to. She was in a near death state when she was found by [[Umbra]]. Once he found her, he gave her food, water and aether. Due to his unique way of casting spells, he didn't need a [[Lesser Quintessence Array]] in order to transfer mana to her. Once she was stable and able to talk he told her the same thing he would tell her when he left and several times in between.

"You, Elise, are a gift to this world. A person born with the power of the Singularities that lie in the beyond. They are capable of devouring reality, bending it and creating it. You have the same power. Others have tried to cure you, fix you. There is nothing wrong with you. You only need to learn how to control it. The spheres beyond guided me to you. One day they will guide you too. That day we will have been blessed the stars beyond and I shall be very proud of you. Your hunger for magic is not a weakness you must learn to live with, it is a weapon you must learn to wield."

Through his occult rituals, he was able to create a link between himself and her, letting her feed on his magic directly.
