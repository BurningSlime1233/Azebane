Zaereon is one of the two [[Moons]] of [[Azebane]] alongside [[Aethoros]]. It is a dusty white deserted and rocky moon., often called the White Wastes in reference to [[Hades]] being called the Grey Wastes. It is very rich in minerals and other rare mineable materials. It does not rain much and the water that flows contains dissolved dust making it undrinkable. As a result, the majority of races that require regular food consume the fungi and lichen that grows and also use them to obtain drinkable water. Other races that do not require regular food such as the [[Biot-Savartian]] and [[To'Kustar]] are able to directly consume the surface of the moon although many prefer it to be prepared in some way such as cooking or garnishing before consumption. 

Due to the harsh and infertile nature of the soil, no farming is possible and as a result any settlement on Zaereon that requires regular food inhabits near sources of Moonwater where food can grow. Other species like [[To'Kustar]] and [[Biot-Savartian]]s can be found all over.
