Planets are the largest of the celestial bodies besides [[Stars]] and orbit around them with the exception of the [[Rogue Planets]]. Planets may be Solid or Gaseous. [[Planetary Dragons]] seem to mimic these natural formations. Planets may or may not have life which is linked to how closely connected they are to the [[Weave]].
