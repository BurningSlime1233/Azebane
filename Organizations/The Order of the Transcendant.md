It is the largest group of warriors, mages and spellblades in all of the [[Planes]] dedicated to protecting, maintaining and regulating Portals and Gateways between the Planes. They have outposts at most portals and bases scattered across all the planets and moons. Their main headquarters jumps between the planes at random. The Order is led by a group of 7 faceless individuals, rumored to be legendary former adventurers. The leaders are called [[The Imperceptible]] and they reside in the Plane-hopping fortress that is the headquarters of the Order. The fortress is called [[The Seventh Bastion]].

The existence of the Order is a secret not divulged to most. The Order is known to form pacts and deals with powerful entities and groups regardless of alignment. Their only goal is to maintain order and prevent interplanar war. The Order was founded by the God [[Sardior]]. His true identity is only known by the Imperceptible and a few other close divine associates. Not even the highest ranking members who know the identity of the Imperceptible are unaware that the Carmine King is actually the God of Gem Dragons. The members of the Imperceptible have changed as newer worlds are added to the list of known worlds. Older members have either retired to some corner, died, or been imprisoned. [[Plane]]
