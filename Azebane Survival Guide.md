## Session 0
Livia, Istara and Victus first arrived in [[Fenhaven]] on [[Correlaire]] 5, 308 [[The Third Dawn|TD]]. They were all solo adventurers who had signed up so they decided to group up for the treasure hunt. They took a quest to investigate. The party found that [[Wererat|wererats]] were entering the basement from the sewers and stealing. The party defeated the wererats and received payment from the [[Gnome|gnome]] who put up the quest, Rasben Starkboot. They ended the night by sleeping in the cheapest tavern in the city.

## Session 1
When the party woke up, Larry had gone on a drinking spree. A gnome woman from the guild arrived to inform the party that the wererats they fought were not dead and attacked the gravekeeper before fleeing into the sewers. The party attended the start of the treasure hunt. The party accepted the first quest from the city alchemist to find potion ingredients and another from the guards to look for a group of thieves. They also spoke to a few birds to gather information regarding the quests. They must gather the following potion ingredients, 7 Blooms of [[Chasm Shrooms]], 12 Sprouts of [[Arcane Blossoms]], 5 [[Warts of the River]]. They obtained the River warts and fought some Giant [[Crocodiles]] by travelling east of the city through the river that flows through it. They collected its meat and paid the birds with it.

## Session 2
The party met with a new member, Rowan Embers. The party killed the bandits but were unable to get the bandits as well as the loot back, gaining them only one fragment of three. The birds also returned with [[Swamp Lily|Swamp Lilies]] which can be converted to Arcane Blossoms by treating with magic. The party slept at the tavern to end the day.

## Session 3
The part woke up to find Rowan Embers missing from his room and decided to continue their journey. They travelled north west from the city towards a chasm. Upon the chasm sits a [[The Simic Combine|Simic Combine]] [[Zonot]]. On the way they ran into a [[Troll]] alone which is rather uncommon. At the chasm they did not enter the Zonot and descended the chasm and found a mushroom laden cave. They fought some Giant [[Spiders]] and [[Ettercap|Ettercaps]]. 

## Session 4
The party met some [[Myconids]] and [[Kraul]] who took them deeper in the cave. They recognized the party as having a chosen of [[Psilofyr|The Carrion King]] and [[Kelemvor|The Judge of the Damned]] and since the party was respectful they did not attack. The Kraul are part of [[The Golgari Swarm]] and are now working with the Myconids of this world. There
