- [[Valorian]]

## Session 0
Livia, Istara and Victus first arrived in [[Fenhaven]] on [[Correlaire]] 5, 308 [[The Third Dawn|TD]]. They were all solo adventurers who had signed up so they decided to group up for the treasure hunt. They took a quest to investigate. The party found that [[Wererat|wererats]] were entering the basement from the sewers and stealing. The party defeated the wererats and received payment from the [[Gnome|gnome]] who put up the quest, Rasben Starkboot. They ended the night by sleeping in the cheapest tavern in the city.

## Session 1
when the party woke up, Larry had gone on a drinking spree. A gnome woman from the guild arrived to inform the party that the wererats they fought were not dead and attacked the gravekeeper before fleeing into the serers.
