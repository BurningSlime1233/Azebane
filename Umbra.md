Umbra is a [[Faceless]] wanderer and traveler and one of the few Faceless who knows of [[Hastur|The King in Yellow]]. He knows not of how his kind relate to the King but he knows that the King is important. The King speaks to him through [[The Song of the Spheres]] in his broken mind. He was once like the others of his kind until his "Awakening" in a temple to the stars made by [[Glar'Tel]]. There he realized the true expanse of the cosmos and saw the face of his creator. This broke and reassembled his mind, and he returned with a copy of the play, [[The King in Yellow]]. This moment on, he would hear the song every night and would hear the words of The Masked One.
