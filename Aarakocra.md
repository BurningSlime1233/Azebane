Aarakocra are a race of bird people that originate from the Plane of Air. They worship various deities such as [[Aerdrie Faenya]], their creator as well as the creator of the [[Avariel]], the Primordial [[Akadi]]. They arrived on [[Azebane]] after [[The Replenishment]] for the most part. Their feathers can be used in making potions of healing. They have strong ties to the Avariel, having the same creator. Their cities and homes tend to be at high altitudes and are always open spaces due to their innate claustrophobia. They hate caves or other enclosed spaces. Aarakocra have strong communities, even in larger cities or towns. They are led by a shaman who is the eldest of the community. Despite their strong ties to their tribe, They prefer using ranged weapons like javelins, longbows and daggers. They have close ties to the [[Wind Dukes of Aaqa]] and are willing to answer their call at all times.
