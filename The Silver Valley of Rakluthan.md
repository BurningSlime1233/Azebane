The Silver Valley of Rakluthan is one of the islands in the continent of Laikedrari that has a forest of trees with silver leaves.. At the center of the island is a castle made of basalt, hidden by the tallest trees on the island. Most visitors to the island do not know of it. Within the castle called Unterhold lives a Death Knight named Phareman. He was created by an evil deity who was killed during the Merging, leaving Phareman to his own devices. No longer under the godâ€™s influence, Phareman felt remorse for his action and retired as the eternal guardian of Rakluthan as penance, under the instruction of the then ruler of the Xiburg Dynasty. He prevents evil doers from exploiting the magicks of the island and those who wish to steal the silver trees. He lives within Unterhold with his skeletal horse, Melancholy, and a small army of undead servants who clean his castle and roam the island as his eyes. He possesses a unique helmet called the Crown of Shattered Souls. This gives him the ability to summon and create undead without corpses, heal and buff his undead creations and split his consciousness across his summons.
