## Unique Effects
- Movement is replaced by Int Score * 10ft.
- Strength is replaced fully by Intelligence
- Dexterity is fully replaced by Wisdom
- Locations or Travel is not consistent cause physical space is not a thing so you can travel to anywhere you have knowledge of. There is no map of the place for the same reasons
20hrs to get to a place you've been to
80hrs to get to a place you've been described
250frs to get to a place for the first time
- All movement is flying. A creature that falls, falls in whatever direction they believe is down. Can be changed using a DC 15 Wis Save
- Hit Dice cannot be spent to heal, No healing on a rest.
- Resting only restores spell slots and power points. Spell points on Astromancers, sorcery points, etc as well as resources for non casters like ki and hit dice are not restored.
- Potions with a time duration last almost forever (170 days is one round lmao)
- Poisons and Diseases dont work because your metabolism is slowed as well
- Leaving the Astral causes time to catch up to you instantly
- Extradimensional Spaces like bags of holding, demiplanes, etc dont work. Only Greater Deities can do that but deities dont do that cause its a no man zone.
- Bags of holding and portable holes open up to the actual size they represent like a baloon
- Sleep is still necessary because its a function of the mind
- Ethereal Plane or Inner plane based spells like conjure Elemental, Etherealness and Shadow magic dont work
- All Spells are/can be quickened for free
- Spells with longer cast times take half the time to cast
- Spellcasting is so easy its basically pleasurable and caster can get addicted to it. They find casting spells on other planes unfulfilling and yearn to return to the Astral where magic Is pure. They also get trigger happy and become depressed when out of magic.
