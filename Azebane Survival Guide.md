# Act 1 (Introduction)
## Session 0
Livia, Istara and Victus first arrived in [[Fenhaven]] on [[Correlaire]] 5, 308 [[The Third Dawn|TD]]. They were all solo adventurers who had signed up so they decided to group up for the treasure hunt. They took a quest to investigate. The party found that [[Wererat|wererats]] were entering the basement from the sewers and stealing. The party defeated the wererats and received payment from the [[Gnome|gnome]] who put up the quest, Rasben Starkboot. They ended the night by sleeping in the cheapest tavern in the city.

## Session 1
When the party woke up, Larry had gone on a drinking spree. A gnome woman from the guild arrived to inform the party that the wererats they fought were not dead and attacked the gravekeeper before fleeing into the sewers. The party attended the start of the treasure hunt. The party accepted the first quest from the city alchemist to find potion ingredients and another from the guards to look for a group of thieves. They also spoke to a few birds to gather information regarding the quests. They must gather the following potion ingredients, 7 Blooms of [[Chasm Shrooms]], 12 Sprouts of [[Arcane Blossoms]], 5 [[Warts of the River]]. They obtained the River warts and fought some Giant [[Crocodiles]] by travelling north of the city through the river that flows through it. They collected its meat and paid the birds with it.

## Session 2
The party met with a new member, Rowan Embers. The party killed the bandits but were unable to get the bandits as well as the loot back, gaining them only one fragment of three. The birds also returned with [[Swamp Lily|Swamp Lilies]] which can be converted to Arcane Blossoms by treating with magic. The party slept at the tavern to end the day.

## Session 3
The part woke up on Correlaire 7 to find Rowan Embers missing from his room and decided to continue their journey. They travelled east from the city towards a chasm. Upon the chasm sits a [[The Simic Combine|Simic Combine]] [[Zonot]]. On the way they ran into a [[Troll]] alone which is rather uncommon. At the chasm they did not enter the Zonot and descended the chasm and found a mushroom laden cave. They fought some Giant [[Spiders]] and [[Ettercap|Ettercaps]]. 

## Session 4
The party met some [[Myconids]] and [[Kraul]] who took them deeper in the cave. They recognized the party as having a chosen of [[Psilofyr|The Carrion King]] and [[Kelemvor|The Judge of the Damned]] and since the party was respectful they did not attack. The Kraul are part of [[The Golgari Swarm]] and are now working with the Myconids of this world. There was a party of dead, less respectful adventurers being converted to fertilizer. The party was given the needed Chasm Shrooms on the condition they kill a [[Krasis]] that was causing trouble in the area. While leaving, the party met another group of adventurers, Rarkon, [[Athela Monsterrat]] and [[Ruby Chain]]. They decided to travel together for safety and were ambushed by a [[Plaxkrasis]]. The party slew the Plaxkrasis and a Kraul warrior who was following them gave the party their second fragment for their work. The party was impressed by Rarkon and he later joined the party and replaced Rowan. The party met up with the alchemist and Livia converted the Swamp Lilies into Arcane Blossoms using a [[Lesser Quintessence Array]].

## Session 5
The party levelled up to 4 and decide to run some errands in [[Fenhaven]] before heading towards the final section of the hunt. Istara and Victus visited the temple of Kelemvor where Istara gave a donation and officially began his journey to being a paladin of Kelemvor. He also took 1d4 psychic damage for the first time as he spoke [[Loki]]'s name when his blade was drawn. Victus got the tip to head to [[Einshold]] and visit a Library of [[Azuth]].  They also asked to purchase mounts but decided not to indulge. While travelling they fought some Scorpions, [[Meenlocks]] and [[Redcaps]].

## Session 6
The party rested outside the entrance to [[The Labyrinthine Dungeon]] where a lone warforged adventurer, Valorian, stumbled into their camp. His party had died and he decided to join this party as a last resort. The party rested and introductions were made in the morning on Correlaire 8 during which Istara's psychic damage activated again. The party delved into the depths and were warned by an injured party that the dungeon held some of the worst things they had experienced in their lives. The party moved on regardless and first fought a pair of [[Spectators]]. They then fought a [[Wight]] and a pair of [[Ogre Zombies]]. At 2/3 successes needed to reach the halfway point the party was pumped up with their success, unprepared for the upcoming room. The third room resembled an endless and open swamp where they saw a [[Catoblepas]] who proceeded to kill the entire party except Rarkon who escaped through the entrance. The party's remains were consumed by the ground which re opened into a familiar stone environment where they were resurrected with half their gold.

## Session 7
The party took some time to gather their bearing and calm down before being forced to trudge forwards. Valorian became non verbal and Livia and Rarkon gave up their gold to Istara so they wouldn't lose money. The last room before the halfway point, the party found themselves in a graveyard puzzle. They got to the halfway point and took a rest before moving forward. During this, Livia received a vision from The Carrion King. The party then continued forward found themselves in a field with crops growing and a man standing by a large cauldron. He gave the party a recipe of Green Delight Vegetable Stew in Draconic. Eventually they were able to locate the ingredients and prepare the stew to move forward. They battled a [[Fire Myrmidon]] and a pack of [[Gnolls]]. Lastly they fought a [[Blood Amniote]] before moving forward to the finale.

## Session 8
The final room of the dungeon opened up into a vast hellish landscape. There was another party present, the [[Anointed Legion of Asmodeus]]. Both parties rushed to obtain the gold stature at the end, battling a [[Babau]], [[Manticores]], Wretches of [[Kyuss]] and [[Star Spawn]] Grues. A tough battle ended with Livia permanently dead and the Anointed Legion winning. The Anointed legion stole the win from Livia who first picked up the statue. The party left dejected and waited outside the entrance for Livia to be resurrected. They party exited the the dungeon at 6pm and waited outside until about 2 am while the other adventurers exited and began travelling back to [[Fenhaven]]. At about 3 am Rarkon heard Livia scream in the woods and started running in that direction on all fours. They met a crystalline witch standing in a clearing surrounded by bodies and destroyed plant matter. The area was infused in fungal magic that was unlike Livia's. The party began infighting with Rarkon blaming Elise, Elise and Victus blaming Rarkon and Istara trying to maintain peace. Rarkon realized Elise was innocent and attempted to shoot himself to resurrect Livia using his [[Demon|demonic]] blood to perform a [[Blood Magic]] ritual. Elise stopped him and as the situation was calming down, the dead [[Shambling Mound]] was resurrected and attacked.

# Act 2 (Einshold)

## Session 9
The party was able to kill the shambling mound using Elise's singularity and Victus' Moonbeam. The party and Elise walked back to [[Fenhaven]]. Upon returning to the city, they met with a gnome messenger from [[House Deneith]] telling them to go speak to the director of the Adventuring guild before sleeping. The director of the guild, [[Lord Eldevar Deneith]], third heir of House Deneith, expressed his concern for the party not returning on time. He apologized for Livia's death and said that the guild will be trying their best to get her out from the Labyrinth. He admitted that they didn't fully understand the dungeon and arent sure of its origins. The party left to sleep in the rooms purchased for them by the guild while Elise stayed back to talk to Lord Eldevar. Victus and Istara went to their rooms to sleep but Rarkon stayed in the tavern to drink. Elise spoke to Eldevar and she told him about the chance that Livia may have made a deal with [[Zuggtmoy]] but Eldevar said that it was impossible to enter the Labyrinth and there was no chance Zuggtmoy could reach. Elise brought up the possibility of Zuggtmoy being in the Labyrinth all along which concerned Eldevar. Meanwhile Istara spoke to his patron [[Aziraphale]]. He was transported into [[The Fugue Plane]] for the first time where [[Aziraphale]] greeted him. He said that he wanted to speak to Istara regarding something important. He asked Istara how the Treasure Hunt went and how the rest of the group was. He was upset to find that they had lost and thought Istara was joking when he said that Livia had died. He grew even more concerned to find that almost the whole party had died yet none of the souls had arrived in the Fugue Plane. He summoned [[Spirit of Death|Spirits of Death]] and [[Psychopomps]] to ask if anyone had reaped Livia's soul. After finding no results, he told Istara that he would try to find out why something like this happened and told Istara that he had been busy for the past few days due to work in [[Laikedrari]]. He gave Istara his task to complete to become a Paladin of [[Kelemvor]], which was to ensure that Victus remain on the correct path after which he was dismissed. This greatly upset Istara. Meanwhile, Elise was getting up from her talk with Eldevar when she began to hear the nostalgic songs that [[Umbra]] used to sing her during their time together. Her calm and focused demeanor broke as she rushed outside, hoping to meet him. Outside, just above the walls of the city, Umbra was floating but he had the crystalline growths that she did and behind Umbra there was a large Singularity, not unlike hers, growing larger and larger. It was able to pull the two moons and began to destroy the city around her until all of a sudden she was back in the room with Eldevar, just getting up when she heard [[The Song of the Spheres]] again. This time the song sounded different, more ethereal, stranger and as she rushed outside, Umbra was nowhere to be seen but as she looked into the sky, she knew that she too could now hear the songs that Umbra would relay to her. She recalled what Umbra had told her once before "One day, you will be able to hear the Song of the Spheres yourself, and I will be very proud of you."
## Session 10

The Session starts with Elise heading to the tavern to sleep but she spots a group of mercenaries entering using the east gate which is normally closed. She decides to follow them stealthily and sees them heading towards the city center but is interrupted by Rarkon who claims to be heading out for a walk. She, being suspicious of him, decides to follow him and they talk. Rarkon knows Elise distrusts him and he will show her his memories in Einshold in order to prove himself to her. With that, Elise heads back to the inn to sleep while Rarkon continues his walk.

4 hours later, in the morning, Istara and Victus wake up and head down for coffee. Rarkon, returning from his walk, joins them and so does Elise, just waking up. Istara talks about leaving the party and decides to follow the path of [[Bahamut]] and abandon Kelemvor. He was quite unhappy with his task to 'babysit' Victus and seeks to redeem himself. The rest of the party plans to head to Einshold after Livia's funeral in a few days. While they are leaving, they are interrupted by the Anointed Legion of Asmodeus who apologize to them about Livia's death. The party does not take this well.

The party heads out on a shopping trip but they spot commotion at the city center where they find the mutilated body of Rowan Embers. Upon investigating, Elise and Rarkon find a branding on his neck of the same symbol as the [[Church of the Broken Hammer]]. Rarkon tells Elise about his past with the Church and [[The Iron Revel]]. Istara leaves to go to the temple of Bahamut while the rest of the party leave to investigate further what the people at night were doing.

They head down an alleyway, following the mercenaries tracks to a door requiring a password. Victus attempts to guess, triggering a glyph of warding hurting the party and alerting the guards. They run out and meet the guards. Rarkon slips away and Elise and Victus fail to distract the guards. Elise resist arrest but fails and she and Victus are taken in for interrogation. She is put under the [[Zone of Truth]]. She says that they are adventurers investigating a mystery which convinces the guards to let her go. 

Meanwhile Istara is in the temple of Bahamut. He talks to the head paladin who accepts Istara. Right before he says that he commits to being a paladin of Bahamut, [[Aziraphale]], stops time and speaks to Istara in his mind. He asks one final time if he wants to break his pact. Istara says yes and [[Aziraphale]] tearfully breaks the pact. This causes the permanent 8th level mind blank and mental barrier that Istara had to fade, flooding him with his past memories. That same moment, the Mentor is now able to find Istara and appears. The Mentor stuns both Istara and the Paladin, kill Istara and leaves with the Divinity Engine.

When being taken to the Fugue Plane, Istara finds himself in a forest where he makes a deal to be a servant to what he believes to be Psilofyr but is in reality [[Fraz'urb'luu]], the Last Arbiter of Unreality.

## Session 11

The party sits down at the Celebration ceremony where [[Lord Eldevar Deneith]] announces the winners and apologizes for those who died during the challenge. The Anointed Legion then begins to speak, declining joining the Adventuring Guild and pledging their allegiance to [[The Order of Desolation]]. They then, in a flash of hellfire, change their armor to bear the symbol of  [[Asmodeus]] and the [[Highbreed]] touches his ring and they teleported out of there. Elise rushes forwards to investigate. Lord Eldevar then calls up the party to award them gold and magic items, including those for some of the missing members except Valorian. The party begins to step down from the stage while a wave of [[Dispel Magic]] would affect the entire city. This causes Elise to nearly die, failing 2 death saves and falling over. 

This Dispel Magic  would end the [[Imprisonment]] spell on Cheonma and he would begin walking towards [[Fenhaven]]. Rarkon and Elise wait stay in the town center and then head back to the tavern as Elise was quite unwell. Victus headed to the temple of Bahamut and would speak to the lone Paladin in the temple. Victus would speak to the Paladin and they would search through the temple looking for Istara. Victus would head back to the tavern and Elise would take some rest. During this, Cheonma would go to a diner owned by [[House Ghallanda]] and eat. Elise and Rarkon realized that Victus did not do a very good job investigating and began heading back to the Temple of Bahamut. On their way, they met with Cheonma and after some banter, he decided to accompany the party to the temple. The door to the temple was closed and Elise saw that the Dragonborn Paladin, [[Ochesh Troumorn]] was indoors and staring out a window. The party entered in and confronted the paladin. Victus noticed a glint of magic in the Paladin's eye and the party attacked.

After a tough battle, the party killed and defeated the Paladin. He was raised by Cheonma as an Undead Vassal and the party brought him to Lord Eldevar. They were put into a Zone of Truth where they were questioned. After interrogating them, Eldevar would continue the investigation himself as it was his friend.

## Session 12

Jardogan is the magic item salesman of [[Fenhaven]]. He is a 8th level Forge Cleric and a half [[Dwarf]]. 2,700 gold for a house that Victus buys. The price is pretty fair. Value goes down after flooding and up once the town is fully made. Vatash, 55 year old Kalashtar and real estate agent in Fenhaven. The Mayor is an orc called Steel Crusher Zhall. The party travelled forwards through the swamp. They had 3 encounters on day 1. Day 2 and 3 they had no encounters. They rolled 2 Grassland and 1 Forest encounter for day 4. The first was the Planetary Dragon which approached them as the session ended.

## Session 13

Planetary Dragon gave Elise the spell [[Voice of Omeltegar]] after she showed him what she could do. He also told her he would call on her if he needed a task to be done. 

## Session 14

## Session 16

Party arrives at the night of the funeral, difficult to find places to stay
Not all homes are not celebrating, Dead kids
1 Day spent long resting.

Umbra meets Elise at night once they find a room and she's alone. Talks to her about her allies. Warns her not to sing the song of the stars to others. Ask her how she is. Does not answer anything about the place she saw or where he's been.

In the morning, Elise and Rarkon meet up with Cheonma for breakfast where Cheonma reveals his past as a conqueror. This seems to upset Rarkon and Cheonma asks Elise to buy items for him with his share of the Adamantine. 

## Session 17

As Cheonma leaves, the party fills Victus in on what he missed. Rarkon says he has some personal business, hoping to talk to an old contact of his. He insists on going alone and heads out while Elise and Victus go to the guard station to report the Neogi ship. The guard is very uncaring about the situation, believing its not the business of the guards as it is beyond the area of Einshold. This annoys Elise. Elise and Victus meet an [[Accursed]] named [[Buster]] who joins the group. Victus calls Elise a Hypocrite for not pursuing the Neogi herself. 

As they leave the guard station, they spot Rarkon leaving a tavern, arm in arm with a pair of guards, laughing and joking around, mug of ale in hand. He spots the party and bids the guards farewell, who return to the guard station. Elise complains to him about the guards being lazy, to which he calls over one of the guards, a human named John, and asks him to fill the report for Elise. The party also notices a missing poster for the kid they saw in the woods. John asks the party if they want to talk to the family to which they agree.

The party heads over to the family of the dead kid, on the 3rd floor of an apartment building. The parents seem to have the same tattoos as the child, the same rune written all over their body. They seem very distraught at the news and ask when they saw the boy. Realizing it was 3 days ago, the couple collect some things from their pantry and rush out to locate their child. Victus again calls Elise a hypocrite for not helping more. 

They then go looking for lunch, going to a taco truck run by a [[Tiefling]] Cleric of [[Sebekar]] named [[Debauchery]]. She says she has her secret recipe and she travels around the world, selling tacos. Victus hopes to have her as a chef in his travelling tavern.

The party then heads into the cheaper part of town, locating a tavern called the Steel Toe. They purchase 2 rooms for cheap. Here, Victus annoys Elise enough that she uses her Breath of Omeltegar to knock him unconscious. She then heals him using a potion and he is upset. He steps out and is run over by a criminal on a runaway cart. The remainder of the party steps out and Elise is run over by the guards in close pursuit with a carriage powered by Velociraptors. Rarkon and Buster avoid this. They then decide to go back indoors and sleep the rest of the day, calling it a night at 3pm. Elise nearly locks Rarkon out but he tackles her onto the bed.
