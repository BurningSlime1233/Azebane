The Abyssal Rot is an area of high amounts of chaotic and abyssal energy created by an incredibly powerful conjurer and demonologist [[Endel’a’daneth]], wielder of [[The Tome of the Black Heart]]. [[Endel’a’daneth]] found the tome and used it to create the abyssal rot and enslave the demon lord [[Kerzit]] who serves as his protector. Although he has yet to master the Tome of the Black Heart, he is its most adept user since its creator. The Abyssal Rot has caused the land to become dead and decayed, covered in dead flora and what fauna remains is either corrupted or invasive fauna from the Abyss. Endel’a’daneth started the spread of the Rot at the heart of the largest city in west [[Laikedrari]]. He renamed the city to [[Endelheart]] in his name and erased the memory of the original name of the city from the minds of every mortal creature in the Xia-Ruph system.
