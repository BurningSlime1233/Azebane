Idarucizumab is one of the most well known lich for a reason. He is the founder and Director of one of the best magic Schools in the System and one of the few existing Ultralich. Thraeranylballyth is the name of the gargantuan undead Dragon Turtle upon which the school is built. The Dragon Turtle is zombie-like in nature and almost entirely hollow. Only a skeleton is present with thousands of thin and strong muscles, nerves and tendons connecting the bones to each other and the flesh. It serves as the standing home, library, office and laboratory to Idarucizumab. The Dragon Turtle acts like a thrall in his service. It is usually traveling the unclaimed waters of Nivermouth and Kinito.

  

The school atop it is called the Citadel of Forbidden Halls. The surface area of the shell is about 1.5 million Sq ft oval with its radii being ~625 and ~825 feet. The building takes up about 55% of the surface and is a massive 19 story castle made of wrought iron and magical basalt. It is immune to non magical damage and all elemental damage. The school teaches all kinds of magic and magic related subjects. Most of the teachers are simulacri of Idarucizumab with a few trusted individuals. An army of thousands of Magen patrol and manage the castle, permoring all sorts of duties like cleaning, cooking and security.
