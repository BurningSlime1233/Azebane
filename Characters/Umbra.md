Umbra is a [[Faceless]] wanderer and traveler and one of the few Faceless who knows of [[Hastur|The King in Yellow]]. He knows not of how his kind relate to the King but he knows that the King is important. The King speaks to him through [[The Song of the Spheres]] in his broken mind. He was once like the others of his kind until his "Awakening" in a temple to the stars made by [[Glar'Tel]]. There he realized the true expanse of the cosmos and saw the face of his creator. This showed him the source of the songs and voices, [[The King in Yellow]]. The King gave him a copy of the play and told him of a prophet of his that would arrive called The One Who Devours. This would go on to be [[Elise]] whom he would mentor.
