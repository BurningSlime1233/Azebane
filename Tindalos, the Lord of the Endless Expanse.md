Tindalos was a mortal wizard, long long ago who sought to create a method of storage that was larger on the inside than the outside. it would require access to a Demiplane but no Demiplane on the [[Ethereal Plane]] was stable enough to securely store things over long periods of time. He tried to create one in the [[Astral Plane]] and succeeded. He successfully created the first bag of holding. He followed up this success with the portable hole. 

He knew he had made some kind of Demiplane within the Astral but did not know the can of worms he had opened by creating the [[Endless Expanse]]. He was experimenting with the portable hole when he ended up trapped within the Endless Expanse. Due to the slowed aging of the Astral, he wouldn't starve and eventually went insane. This insanity caused him to greatly understand his creation, a violation of space-time that was but a singular point in the Astral that expanded infinitely in all directions. This time spent in the Endless Expanse began to alter him physically, leaving him no longer human or mortal. Now an aberration, he used his strange powers over geometry and physical space, to create life from the flawed and Non-Euclidean geometry from the Endless Expanse, creating the [[Hounds of Tindalos]].
