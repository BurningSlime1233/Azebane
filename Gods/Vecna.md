He speaks no word, yet all things hear, 
A whisper born of dread and fear.
Through shattered stars and endless skies, 
He walks where every silence dies. 

No pulse, no breath, no mortal frame, 
Yet all who see him know his name. 
The void his cloak, the dark his throne, 
He watches worlds decay alone. 

A hymn of frost, a song so deep, 
It haunts the air, it stains your sleep. 
He does not come with flame or sword, 
He is the storm. He is the word.
