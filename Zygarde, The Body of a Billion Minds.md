When the [[Gods]] performed [[The Replenishment]] on the planet of [[Azebane]], they did not yet fully trust the mortals to not ruin the Planet and as a result, they used the powers of [[Grumbar]] to create a guardian that would arrive whenever it was needed. This guardian was Zygarde. It was not one independent organism but one composed of billons of smaller parts known as cells. Unique cells known as Cores were sort of the "Leaders" of this organism. A number of cells, along with atleast one Core could form unified entity that behaved like one being. The more that combined, the greater threat they perceived was and the stronger the Zygarde became. They appeared not when mortals were at stake or such petty conflicts but then the safety of the entire planet would be compromised. The largest Zygarde seen consisted of all the cells in one Continent. The form Zygarde takes is based upon the number of Cores present while its size is based on the number of cells.
