The Xiburg Dynasty is a land ruled by the [[Xiburgs]] who have ruled the land since [[The Cleansing]] when the first of the Xiburgs, [[Priscillian Xiburg]], the son of a [[Throne Archon]] of [[Bahamut]], first established the city [[Kashnanz, the Citadel of Radiance]] as a safe haven for all. The divine bloodline of Priscillian continued to rule over the city and expanded their rule to all of Northern [[Laikedrari]] until [[Endel’a’daneth]] created the [[Exar'mu'sharn, the Abyssal Rot|Abyssal Rot]] and destroyed over half of the kingdom. The current ruling Xiburg, Syndell Xiburg, created Thrish’Kaar along with the Amarunda Empire and came into power. She is a 17th lvl Sorlock and rules alongside an Adult Silver Dragon Delathmir, Master of Fangs. Delathmir, in his dragon form, resides on a cloud city above the capital and as the husband of Syndell in Kashnanz when polymorphed.
