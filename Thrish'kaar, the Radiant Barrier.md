The Radiant Barrier is a large wall of golden light that protects the majority of Laikedrari from the dangers of [[Exar'mu'sharn, the Abyssal Rot|Exar’mu’sharn]] and deals a large amount of damage (18d10 + 36 radiant) to any fiend or undead crossing through unprotected. Powerful fiends and undead are able to use magic to weaken or nullify the barrier at points to pass through. The barrier is powered by worship and spells. [[Endel'aEndel]] occasionally sends small armies through the barrier in order to reduce worshippers and casters and weaken the barrier enough to allow the Abyssal Rot to expand.
