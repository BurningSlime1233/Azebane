Shadowheart magic, also known as Enochian or Soul magic is one of the types of magic that is usable by almost all types of beings, those that possess souls. Despite its universality it is very rarely seen being used due to its cost. The more power spells of this type could greatly harm the caster, even to the point of destroying their soul. This understanding however is a partial truth.

It is called Shadowheart magic because the Shadow and the Heart are two of the five aspects of a person's soul. Both of which are burnt off as a part of casting these spells. The Shadow is the impact the person has on the world, their past and the legacy they leave, burnt to enforce that legacy in the moment. The Heart is their morality, their sense of good and evil, burnt as to extract pure positive or negative energy.
