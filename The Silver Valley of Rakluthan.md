The Silver Valley of [[Rakluthan]] is one of the islands in the [[Continent|continent]] of [[Laikedrari]] that has a forest of trees with silver leaves. At the center of the island is a castle made of basalt, hidden by the tallest trees on the island. Most visitors to the island do not know of it. Within the castle called [[Unterhold]] lives a [[Death Knight]] named [[Phareman]]. He was created by an evil deity who was killed during [[The Merging]], leaving Phareman to his own devices. No longer under the godâ€™s influence, Phareman felt remorse for his action and retired as the eternal guardian of [[Rakluthan]] as penance, under the instruction of the then ruler of [[Amarunda Empire]]. He prevents evil doers from exploiting the magicks of the island and those who wish to steal the silver trees. He lives within Unterhold with his skeletal horse, Melancholy, and a small army of undead servants who clean his castle and roam the island as his eyes. He possesses a unique helmet called the [[Crown of Shattered Souls]]. This gives him the ability to summon and create undead without corpses, heal and buff his undead creations and split his consciousness across his summons.

His army consists of: 
- 1 [[Dragonbone Golem]]
- 4 [[Grisgol]]
- 6 [[Blackwings]]
- 10 [[Boneclaws]]
- 20 [[Bone Golems]]
- 33 [[Coldlight Walkers]]
- 47 [[Deathlock Wights]]
- 50 [[Ghostly Legionnaires]]
- 237 [[Skeleton]] Warriors
