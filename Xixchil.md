Xixchil are six limbed mantis folk from a different [[Material Plane]] and appear not too dissimilar from [[Thri-Kreen]]. The world they come from was once incredibly dangerous and filled with predators and threats resulting in their staunch belief in the survival of the fittest but not in a cruel way. They instead believe that each lifeform must be allowed to grow and adapt to improve. They believe that since their body is the home of the soul, it should the soul much like a home expresses the personality of the one who lives within. Xixchil embellish them selves in jewelry, fine clothing ornaments and whatever they believe best represents themselves. This passion for development and self advancement has made them experts of bodily modification and surgery. They adore modifying their own body as much as they adore adorning it with riches and encourage others to do the same as well.
