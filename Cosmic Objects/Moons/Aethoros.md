Aethoros is one of the two moons of [[Azebane]] along with [[Zaereon]]. It is covered in a lush and beautiful green jungle filled with wildlife called [[]], with hundreds of floating islands, drifting lazily around, that occasionally opens up into its watery depths that form the majority of its actual mass called [[The Stomach of Aethoros]]. This unique geography results in a very flora and fauna filled surface whereas the oft below ground waters, being blocked of sunlight, have little to know light.

One of the many strange things of Aethoros are the hundreds of ancient, rune carved polyhedron-shaped stones that float ominous across the moon. Strewn in runes few, if any, know the meaning of, etched onto them in a time long forgotten. These stones, called [[]], are massive, all exactly the same size at 10 miles long exactly. It is believed that these monoliths are the cause of or atleast related to the drifting islands. It is believed that the drifting islands were once part of the surface and the monoliths lifted them up, creating the opening to [[The Stomach of Aethoros]]
