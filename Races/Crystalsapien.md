Crystalsapiens are silicon-based life forms with an unknown origin. They have no known history, origin or culture as they just seem to appear out of nowhere. They are very good at absorbing and redirecting energy and donâ€™t need to breathe. They tend to bond closely to whatever community they first arrive in, provided they are not treated poorly, resulting in their alignment matching that community. They prefer smaller and more closely knit communities, not being spotted in cities but more so in smaller and more remote towns and villages. Not a single specimen of [[Crystalsapien]] is found to be "weak" or anywhere close to "normal". They all appear to be quite powerful, making them potent defenders of whatever community they belong to. Their lifespan easily stretches into centuries and on occasion over a thousand years. They don't seem to reproduce or multiply in anyway leading researchers to believe that their rarity and power may be related, as something may have wiped out the weaker members of their kind.
