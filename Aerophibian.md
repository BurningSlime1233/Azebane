Aerophibians are reptiles from the planet [[Cirilinov]] that look like red and yellow manta rays. They can survive in both water and air which is especially interesting due to the planet's severe lack of water. They are able to fly through the [[Astral Plane]] at unparalleled speeds and cannot be forcefully sent to other planes. They are highly resistant to radiation and radiant damage. They can fire blasts of energy through their eyes and have no need to breathe.
