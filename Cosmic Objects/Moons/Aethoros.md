Aethoros is one of the two moons of [[Azebane]] along with [[Zaereon]]. It is covered in a lush and beautiful green jungle filled with wildlife that occasionally opens up into its watery depths that form the majority of its actual mass called [[The Stomach of Aethoros]]. This unique geography results in a very flora and fauna filled surface whereas the oft below ground waters, being blocked of sunlight, have little to know light.
