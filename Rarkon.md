Rarkon is a [[Kijin]] [[Jaeger]] and Child of [[Baphomet]]. His mother, Torah Willowoak, was a human cleric who had travelled to [[The Abyss]] to battle Baphomet. He has an older brother named [[Cassadius]]. He and Cassadius were kept in Baphomet's [[Tower of Science]] where Baphomet and multiple [[Sibriex]] Fleshwarpers would experiment on and modify their body. At around 5 years of age he and Cass were given to a group of Baphomet worshippers that were part of the [[Church of the Broken Hammer]]. The Church raised and trained them along with several others including [[Valorian]] and [[Bralzyrudimyth]] Carezagrix Haerezael.
