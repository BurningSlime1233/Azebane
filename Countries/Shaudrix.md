Shaudrix is one of the most technologically advanced countries on the planet. It is the leading developer of magical technology. It is considered one of the safest countries on [[Azebane]] due to its ever present security and surveillance facilities. Shaudrix manufactures many complex mechanical structures like Wildjammers, Skyships, Vaults, Automatons, Elevators, Firearms and more.

The capital city is [[Etherhold]] and is the biggest manufacturer of purified aether. It is also the city where leaders of all the countries meet for important decisions and is considered a neutral meeting ground. It is also where representatives from other planets and moons meet when meeting on Azebane. These meetings take place at the Mithril Sanctuary, a beautiful and resilient structure made of mithril and toughened glass.

Shaudrix is led by an Artificial Intelligence called [[Valeria]]. She was created by a team of 20 artificers who built her physical architecture and her consciousness is composed of those artificers and she stores their souls. Valeria leads the country in all its aspects and also is the lead engineer, making advancements and rivaling those of engineers from other planets. Her physical architecture is at the center of Etherhold and a good amount of the cityâ€™s aether is used to power Valeria.
