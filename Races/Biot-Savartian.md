Biot-Savartians are metallic creatures with innate magnetic abilities. They originate on [[Zaereon]] and have great mastery over magnetism. Their bodies are much more durable and made of metallic inorganic material. They are all asexual and prefer being referred to as masculine or gender neutral. They do not give birth but are created periodically on [[Zaereon]] due to its magnetic field and do not die of old age, often dying of either disease or being killed.
