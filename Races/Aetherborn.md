Aetherborn are living byproducts created due to aether refinement most often found in or around large aether refineries like those in [[Kamegnosia]] or [[Shaudrix]]. They lack sex and cannot reproduce. They tend to have short lives unless extended using magic or magical items. They live these short lives and seek to experience all aspects of life and enjoy endless pleasure and debauchery. A rare few Aetherborn learn to steal the life force of others to extend their own.
