The Accursed are a rare race of animated sentient rags or clothes imbued with magic. They may have missing or too many appendages and may even have zippers which can be opened to reveal their hollow insides. They are not commonly seen and considered a folk tale to dissuade people from leaving their clothes and rags uncared for. Due to their sporadic creation, they don't really have their own culture or community. They only appear to be created on [[Azebane]] and not on any other planet or even moon. The reason for this is still unknown but appears to be demonic in nature. Accursed can be worn by warriors to increase their physical capabilities.
